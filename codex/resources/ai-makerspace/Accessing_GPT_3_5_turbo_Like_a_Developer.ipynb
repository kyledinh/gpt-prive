Since Billy needs to get home before 7PM EDT, we need to convert the time to EDT. San Francisco is in the Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) zone, which is three hours behind EDT. Therefore, 4PM PDT is equivalent to 7PM EDT. This means that Billy would arrive exactly on time by choosing this option.\n\nOption 2: Teleport and then take a bus\nThe teleportation is instantaneous and doesn't consume any time, so Billy would immediately arrive at his destination. However, he still needs to consider the one hour bus ride. If he selects this option, he would take the bus for 1 hour, bringing his arrival time to 2PM local time. Again, converting to EDT, 2PM PDT is equivalent to 5PM EDT. This means that Billy would arrive two hours earlier than his desired time by choosing this option.\n\nIn conclusion, it does matter which travel option Billy selects. If he wants to arrive before 7PM EDT, he should choose the first option of flying and then taking a bus, as it ensures he arrives exactly on time."
